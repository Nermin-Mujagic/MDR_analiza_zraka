Okay, I understand. You're looking for a clear, systematic workflow that integrates all the necessary steps of your analysis, while being mindful of when to use standardized vs. real values. Let's break this down into manageable chunks and specify the data input types for each step.

**Core Principles:**

*   **Real Values for Interpretation and Communication:** You want to preserve real values whenever possible for ease of interpretation and communication of results. Policy makers and other stakeholders will understand micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m³) far better than standardized units.
*   **Standardized Values for Statistical Modeling (Where Necessary):** Standardization is primarily needed for certain statistical models (like KNN imputation and some regression models) to prevent features with larger scales from dominating the results.
*   **Separate Analysis Streams:** Acknowledge and clearly separate the pollutant-specific analysis stream (for visualization, ITSA) from the full dataset analysis stream (for panel regression).
*   **Modularity:** Keep functions modular and flexible so you can easily switch between standardized and real values as needed.

**Proposed Workflow & Data Input Types:**

**PHASE 1: Pollutant-Specific Analysis (SO2, PM10, NO2, NOX)**

This phase focuses on individual pollutants, filtered by region and time, optimized for visualization and ITSA.

1.  **Data Preparation (Pollutant-Specific):**
    *   **Input:** Real Values (raw data in µg/m³)
    *   **Steps:**
        *   Create pollutant-specific DataFrames based on `REGIJE_FILTER`.
        *   Handle missing months (flagging) as previously discussed.
    *   **Output:** Real Values (pollutant-specific DataFrames with flagged missing months)

2.  **Imputation (Pollutant-Specific):**
    *   **Input:** Real Values (pollutant-specific DataFrames with flagged missing months)
    *   **Steps:**
        *   *Temporarily* standardize the relevant features (the pollutant column itself). Store the scaler object for later unscaling.
        *   Apply KNN imputation as discussed.
        *   *Unscale* the imputed values back to their original scale using the stored scaler object.
    *   **Output:** Real Values (pollutant-specific DataFrames with imputed values, in µg/m³)

3.  **Visualization (Pollutant-Specific):**
    *   **Input:** Real Values (pollutant-specific DataFrames with imputed values)
    *   **Steps:**
        *   Create trend visualizations (time series plots, rolling means/SDs).
        *   Create box plots by year/month (seasonal variations).
    *   **Output:** Visualizations (using real values on the axes for easy interpretation)

4.  **Formal Statistical Tests (Pre/Post Directive):**
    *   **Input:** Real Values (pollutant-specific DataFrames with imputed values)
    *   **Steps:**
        *   Conduct t-tests, Wilcoxon tests, or regression-based tests to compare pre- and post-directive pollutant levels.
        *   Account for non-independence of data points within each region (e.g., using paired t-tests or mixed-effects models).
    *   **Output:** Statistical test results (p-values, confidence intervals) in real units.

5.  **Autocorrelation Analysis (ACF/PACF):**
    *   **Input:** Real Values (pollutant-specific DataFrames with imputed values)
    *   **Steps:**
        *   Analyze ACF and PACF plots to identify autocorrelation patterns.
        *   Test for stationarity (ADF test).
    *   **Output:** ACF/PACF plots and stationarity test results.

6.  **Interrupted Time Series Analysis (ITSA):**
    *   **Input:** Real Values (pollutant-specific DataFrames with imputed values)
    *   **Steps:**
        *   Build a regression model with time trend, pre/post directive dummy, and interaction term.
        *   Estimate the impact of the directive on pollutant levels (change in trend and level).
    *   **Output:** ITSA results (coefficients, p-values, confidence intervals) in real units.

**PHASE 2: Full Dataset Analysis (Panel Regression)**

This phase focuses on the complete dataset with all pollutants and regions, used for panel regression.

7.  **Data Preparation (Full Dataset):**
    *   **Input:** Real Values (raw data in µg/m³)
    *   **Steps:**
        *   Create the full DataFrame with all pollutants, regions, and dates.
        *   Handle missing months (flagging) as previously discussed.
    *   **Output:** Real Values (full DataFrame with flagged missing months)

8.  **Imputation (Full Dataset):**
    *   **Input:** Real Values (full DataFrame with flagged missing months)
    *   **Steps:**
        *   *Temporarily* standardize all pollutant columns before imputation. Store the scaler objects for later unscaling, should we need it.
        *   Apply KNN imputation as discussed (using all pollutants to find nearest neighbors).
        *   Potentially, *unscale* the imputed values back to their original scale using the stored scaler object. You might want to leave it scaled if the panel regression requires standardized values, or if it produces more stable regression results. But you have to make the choice based on the statistical results.
    *   **Output:** Either Standardized or Real Values (full DataFrame with imputed values)

9.  **Correlation Analysis (Full Dataset):**
    *   **Input:** Either Standardized or Real Values (full DataFrame with imputed values)
    *   **Steps:**
        *   Calculate correlation matrix between all pollutants *within each region*.
    *   **Output:** Correlation matrix.

10. **Lagged Effects Analysis:**
    *   **Input:** Either Standardized or Real Values (full DataFrame with imputed values)
    *   **Steps:**
        *   Create lagged variables for pollutants (e.g., pollutant levels from the previous year).
    *   **Output:** DataFrame with lagged variables.

11. **Panel Data Regression:**
    *   **Input:** Either Standardized or Real Values (full DataFrame with lagged variables and imputed values)
    *   **Steps:**
        *   Select appropriate panel data model (fixed effects or random effects).
        *   Include control variables (socioeconomic factors, healthcare access, etc.).
        *   Address endogeneity issues (if necessary).
        *   Use robust standard errors.
    *   **Output:** Panel data regression results (coefficients, p-values, confidence intervals).

from sklearn.impute import KNNImputer
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

def impute_missing_months_knn(df, region_col="Region", date_col="Date", n_neighbors=5, standardize=True):
    """
    Imputes missing months using KNN imputation.

    Args:
        df (pd.DataFrame): The DataFrame to impute.

    """
    df_copy = df.copy()

    # Automatically determine the pollutant columns
    pollutant_cols = [col for col in df_copy.select_dtypes(include=np.number).columns if col not in [region_col, date_col]]

    # Store the scaler if Standardize is True
    if standardize:
        scaler = StandardScaler()
        df_copy[pollutant_cols] = scaler.fit_transform(df_copy[pollutant_cols])
    else:
        scaler = None

    def impute_with_knn(group):
        for pollutant in pollutant_cols:
            # Separate data into known and missing values
            known = group[group[pollutant].notna()]
            missing = group[group[pollutant].isna()]

            if len(known) == 0 or len(missing) == 0:  # If all missing or all known, skip imputation
                continue

            # Prepare the data for KNN imputation
            imputer = KNNImputer(n_neighbors=n_neighbors)

            # Fit KNN Imputer on the *known* values
            imputer.fit(known[[pollutant]])
            group.loc[missing.index, pollutant] = imputer.transform(missing[[pollutant]])

        return group

    # Group by Region, Year, and Month
    df_copy = df_copy.groupby([region_col, df_copy[date_col].dt.year, df_copy[date_col].dt.month], group_keys=False).apply(impute_with_knn)

    # Unscale after imputation
    if standardize:
        df_copy[pollutant_cols] = scaler.inverse_transform(df_copy[pollutant_cols])

    return df_copy, scaler

# Example Usage:
# For Pollutant-Specific Analysis (standardize=True, then unscale)
# For Full Dataset Analysis, standardize (and decide later if you want to unscale before panel regression)
```

**Key Benefits of This Workflow:**

*   **Clear Separation:** Clearly separates the pollutant-specific and full dataset analyses.
*   **Real Values for Interpretation:** Preserves real values for visualization, statistical tests, and ITSA, making the results easier to interpret.
*   **Controlled Standardization:** Uses standardization only when necessary for statistical modeling, and provides the flexibility to unscale the data if needed.
*   **Modularity:** The functions are modular and flexible, allowing you to easily switch between standardized and real values.
*   **Manageable Chunks:** Breaks the analysis into manageable chunks, reducing the risk of getting overwhelmed.

**Actionable Steps:**

1.  **Implement the Workflow:** Start by implementing the steps in Phase 1 (pollutant-specific analysis).
